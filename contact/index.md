### Openings

### Openings

We regularly have multiple openings for Postdoc/PhD/MPhil/RA/Internships (all year round) to work on research related to **AI-driven trustworthy autonomous systems**, with a focus on **end-to-end autonomous UAVs** and **end-to-end self-driving cars**. If you are a PolyU student (Undergraduate and MSc students seeking URIS or dissertation supervision) interested in working with me, feel free to drop me an email at **welson.wen@polyu.edu.hk** (together with your transcript and brief introduction) or walk into my office at **room R820**!
