### Openings

We regularly have multiple openings for **Postdoc/PhD/MPhil/RA/Internships** (all year round) to work on research related to **AI-driven trustworthy autonomous systems**, with a focus on **end-to-end autonomous UAVs** and **end-to-end self-driving cars**. If you are a PolyU student (Undergraduate and MSc students seeking URIS or dissertation supervision) interested in working with me, feel free to drop me an email at **welson.wen@polyu.edu.hk** (together with your transcript and brief introduction) or walk into my office at **room R820**!

#### Postdoc/PhD/MPhil/RA Research Directions

- Embodied AI and foundation models for robotics (drones, autonomous vehicles, ground robots)
- High-precision positioning with multi-sensor fusion (LiDAR/Camera/IMU/GNSS) and integrity monitoring
- End-to-end learning for self-driving cars and autonomous UAVs
- Trustworthy and safety-certifiable AI for navigation and control
- Software-hardware co-design for efficient embodied AI systems
- Vision-language-action models and multimodal learning for autonomous systems

For more specific topics, please refer to our [TAS Lab website](https://polyu-taslab.github.io/) and [project page](https://polyu-taslab.github.io/projects/).

#### Application Requirements

For those interested, please send the following materials to **welson.wen@polyu.edu.hk**:

1. **CV** (with education background, publications, awards, and coding experience)
2. **Representative publications list** (if any)
3. **A detailed research proposal** (~6 pages) including abstract, background and literature review, research objectives, proposed methodology, expected outcomes, timeline, and references.

We will reply to you within one week if you are shortlisted for an interview.

**For any candidate, you MUST have at least two of the following:**

1. A strong publication record in top-tier AI/robotics venues (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICRA, IROS, CoRL, CVPR, ICCV);
2. Strong capabilities in coding (proficient in C++ and/or Python, experience with PyTorch/TensorFlow/ROS);
3. Awards or demonstrated excellence in robotics competitions (e.g., RoboMaster, ICRA competitions) are strongly preferred for PhD/MPhil applicants.
