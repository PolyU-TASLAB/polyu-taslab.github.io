## Abstract

Urban roadways often face challenges such as building-induced obstructions, creating significant blind spots and positioning inaccuracies that hinder safe lane spacing and inter-vehicle distance management. Existing solutions lack cost-effective enhancements for positioning and over-the-horizon collaborative sensing technologies, particularly in dense urban environments.

To address these issues, this project proposes a low-cost, high-precision co-location solution specifically designed for urban canyons. Additionally, a collision avoidance warning application is developed to provide early warnings and emergency interventions for collision risks in blind spots.

The proposed approach integrates advanced methodologies: (1) Lane-level positioning services utilizing Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) and 3D city maps for precise lane-level positioning, (2) Multi-vehicle collaborative sensing leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and RTK to enable over-the-horizon sensing and early warnings, and (3) Dynamic model optimization using AI to refine positioning accuracy and develop a prototype multi-vehicle collision avoidance system.

The solution achieves lane-level positioning accuracy with an error margin of less than 0.5 meters and provides collision risk warnings at varying inter-vehicle distances. By significantly reducing traffic accidents caused by urban road challenges, this project offers a transformative step toward safer and more reliable urban transportation systems.
