## Abstract

Research conducted on the lunar surface necessitates the utilization of Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UASs) equipped with sophisticated robotic arms designed for the purpose of collecting soil samples. The primary challenges encountered in this endeavor revolve around the need for precise control over the UASs while navigating through rugged and uneven terrain, all while ensuring the utmost safety of the operation. To tackle these challenges head-on, a cutting-edge multi-robot collaboration system has been conceptualized and put forth as a solution. This innovative system leverages the power of Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) to achieve unparalleled accuracy in positioning the UASs during the soil sample collection process.

Remarkably, the implementation of this collaborative system has yielded remarkable results, boasting a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of merely 0.30 meters. This achievement represents a substantial advancement compared to the conventional methods previously employed in similar research endeavors. A pivotal component of this system is the integration of the Leader-Follower Formation Algorithm, which plays a crucial role in facilitating efficient coordination among multiple robots operating simultaneously in the lunar environment.

Looking ahead, the future research trajectory will be centered around further enhancing the collaborative capabilities of the system. This will entail a deep dive into refining the existing Positioning and Leader-Follower algorithms, with a specific focus on optimizing autonomous navigation techniques and streamlining the soil sampling process. Noteworthy features of the system include automated navigation functionalities, advanced soil identification mechanisms, and seamless soil collection procedures facilitated by the utilization of QR codes for precise localization and task allocation purposes.
