## Introduction
Skyscrapers are one of the features of Hong Kong and its window cleaning is a time-consuming and dangerous work that needs to be completed regularly. The typical solution is to use big machines, such as the “Movable platform” or the “Bosun’s chair” with high power, to navigate the window cleaners to the building’s exterior. Take the PolyU Jockey Club Innovation Tower (JCIT) as an example, 20,000 HKD are required by the cleaning industry to clean 100 m^2 areas (less than 1/20 of the total areas of the JCIT surface) in two weeks. Based on the fuel assumption, a value of carbon emission of 277.8 kgCO2 was caused by the JCIT cleaning in two weeks. The value of the carbon emission will be even more significant when cleaning the rest of the JCIT due to the irregular shape of the JCIT. In fact, part of the JCIT surface is very difficult to clean due to the highly irregular surface which is out of the reach of the typical “Movable platform” or the “Bosun’s chair”. Bigger machines are required but lead to unacceptable carbon reduction accordingly. A solution to efficiently complete the window cleaning is practical and highly expected, which can directly help with carbon reduction at the PolyU campus. Moreover, this is highly expected by lots of “Skyscrapers” in Hong Kong. 

To fill this gap, this project proposes to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to complete the building window cleaning task efficiently after several meeting discussions between the project team members and the PolyU Campus Facilities and Sustainability Office (CFSO), aiming at reducing the carbon emission from existing solutions. The project team has previously accumulated significant achievements in terms of UAV technologies, such as navigation, control, and planning, which is supported by the team’s academic publications records and knowledge transfer to the UAV industry, such as the Meituan with applications for parcel delivery. Also, the project team has the capability of designing the UAV system from scratch. Based on the prototype of the UAV for building window cleaning, the value of carbon emission would be reduced from 277.8 kgCO2 using the existing solution by the cleaning industry, to around 2.91 kgCO2 using the UAV system. The achievement in carbon reduction can be even more significant upon the success and completion of this project. We fully believe that this project will introduce significant impacts to the carbon reduction plan of PolyU, and will also lead to potential impacts to the carbon reduction of Hong Kong.
