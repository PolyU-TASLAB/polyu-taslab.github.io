Demostration about our Autonomous Driving Vehicle and sensor platform.

## Introduction

An autonomous car, also known as a self-driving vehicle, is a sophisticated mode of transportation that can perceive its environment and navigate without the need for human intervention. These vehicles employ a variety of advanced technologies to achieve safe and efficient driving, making them a significant innovation in modern transportation.

A critical aspect of autonomous vehicles is their ability to sense and localize themselves within their surroundings. This capability is essential for navigating complex environments, avoiding obstacles, and making real-time driving decisions. Accurate sensing and localization allow autonomous cars to interpret data from their surroundings and respond appropriately to dynamic conditions.
