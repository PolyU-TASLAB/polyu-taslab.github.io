## Abstract

With the widespread use of the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) in vehicular positioning, real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning has attracted much attention due to its high-precision characteristics. However, in urban canyons, the performance of GNSS-RTK is easily affected by insufficient and low-quality measurements, resulting in unsuccessful ambiguity resolution (AR) and thus large positioning errors. To address this problem, a multi-epoch joint integer AR strategy based on factor graph optimization (FGO) is proposed. This proposed strategy fully utilizes the temporal correlation between all ambiguities in consecutive epochs when conducting AR, adopting soft single-differenced (SD) ambiguity equality constraint instead of ambiguity parameter merging. A complex vehicle-borne low-cost GNSS dataset collected in the urban canyon of Hong Kong was used. The results show that the proposed method can increase the positioning accuracy compared with traditional AR strategy.
