*Hong Kong, September 29th, 2025* â€“ The Aeronautics and Aviation Engineering (AAE) department at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today conducted a drone performance test flight at the Shaw Sports Complex on campus, as part of the sandbox regulatory project for the low altitude economy. This successful event marks a new phase in PolyU AAE's initiative to advance regulatory frameworks and operational standards for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban environments.

The test flight, carried out in collaboration with the Civil Aviation Department (CAD), evaluated key performance metrics of drones under controlled conditions, focusing on safety, efficiency, and compliance with emerging low-altitude airspace regulations. The sandbox project aims to create a scalable model for integrating drone technology into Hong Kong's transportation and logistics ecosystems.

### Sandbox Project Advances Low Altitude Economy Framework

The sandbox regulatory project, led by PolyU AAE, provides a controlled environment for testing and validating drone operations, contributing to the development of standardized safety protocols and performance benchmarks. Today's test flight demonstrated the practical application of these standards, assessing factors such as flight stability, navigation accuracy, and payload capacity.

"Today's test flight is a critical step forward in our low altitude economy initiatives," said a representative from the AAE department. "By working closely with regulatory bodies like CAD, we are paving the way for scalable and safe drone integration in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area."

### Collaborative Efforts for Future Urban Air Mobility

The event highlighted the growing collaboration between academic institutions and government agencies in shaping the future of urban air mobility. The sandbox project not only focuses on technical performance but also addresses regulatory challenges, such as airspace management and public safety.

"PolyU's sandbox project serves as a model for how academia and regulators can work together to foster innovation while ensuring safety and compliance," added a CAD official. "We are excited to see these efforts translate into real-world applications."

### Next Steps for Low Altitude Economy Development

With the successful completion of this test flight, PolyU AAE plans to expand the sandbox project to include more complex scenarios, such as multi-drone operations and extended-visual-line-of-sight (EVLOS) flights. The department will also continue to engage industry partners and policymakers to drive the adoption of low-altitude economy solutions across the region.
