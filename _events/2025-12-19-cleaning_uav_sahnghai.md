### Industry Breakthrough and Market Potential

Conducting a demonstration in a city like Shanghai—characterized by its dense skyline and immense demand for building cleaning services—marks a significant breakthrough for our team in the field of drone-based cleaning.

This milestone not only validates the maturity of our technology but also demonstrates the solution's potential for application in the complex environments of mega-cities.
