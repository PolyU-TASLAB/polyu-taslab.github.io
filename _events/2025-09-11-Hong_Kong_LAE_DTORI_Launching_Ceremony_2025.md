## Hong Kong Launches Low Altitude Economy Drone Take-off Reliability Index Launching Ceremony 2025

*Hong Kong, September 11th, 2025* – In a landmark event for the region’s technological advancement, the Hong Kong Low Altitude Economy Drone Take-off Reliability Index was officially launched today in a high-profile ceremony attended by government officials, industry leaders, and academic experts. The initiative, introduced by the Hong Kong Innovative Smart Applications Association (HKISA), aims to standardize and enhance the safety and operational reliability of drones across the city’s rapidly expanding low-altitude economy.

The ceremony featured a keynote address by representatives from HKISA, who emphasized the critical role of the new index in promoting trust and scalability in commercial and civic drone applications. The index will provide a measurable framework to evaluate drone performance, maintenance standards, and operational safety—key factors for integration into urban airspace.

A highlight of the event was a spectacular demonstration by DAMODA, a leading drone technology company, which showcased a synchronized drone swarm light show. Hundreds of drones took to the skies, forming dynamic and intricate patterns that illustrated both the artistic and functional potential of swarm technology. The display underscored the reliability and precision of drone systems capable of supporting fields such as logistics, emergency response, and public entertainment.
