## Three papers and one workshop are accepted by ITSC 2025

**Hong Kong – July 5, 2025** – TAS Lab is proud to announce its significant presence at the upcoming **2025 IEEE 28th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2025)**. The prestigious international conference, scheduled for November 18-21, 2025, in Gold Coast, Australia, will feature **three accepted research papers** and a **dedicated workshop** led by our research team. This exceptional achievement underscores our group's leadership and commitment to advancing cutting-edge solutions in the field of intelligent transportation.

ITSC is a premier global forum for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to discuss the latest developments and challenges in intelligent transportation systems. Our strong showing at this year's conference reflects the caliber and impact of the research being conducted within our group.

Our accepted papers address critical advancements and innovative approaches across key areas of intelligent transportation:

* **Pioneering Enhanced Navigation in Urban Environments:** The paper titled "Enhancing LEO-GNSS Positioning in Urban Canyons: A Factor Graph Optimization Approach with StarLink Simulations" explores novel methodologies to significantly improve the accuracy of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning in challenging urban environments, particularly through the integration of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations like StarLink. This work is co-authored by Yixin GAO, Weisong WEN, Xikun LIU, Feng HUANG, jiahao HU, and Dongzhe SU.
