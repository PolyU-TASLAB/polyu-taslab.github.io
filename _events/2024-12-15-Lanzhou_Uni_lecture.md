<!-- Add breif description here.  -->
Dr. Wen 's lectureat Lanzhou University,titled "3D LiDAR Aided (3DLA) Urban GNSS Positioning for Autonomous Systems in Urban Canyons", focus on the challenges and advancements in urban positioning for autonomous driving vehicles. 


<!-- Add Main body here -->
Dr. Wen's upcoming lecture will delve into the critical challenges and innovative solutions in urban positioning for autonomous driving vehicles (ADV). As cities become more urbanized, the accuracy of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) is compromised by signal reflections from buildings and vehicles, leading to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) issues. Dr. Wen will discuss his pioneering work in developing perception-aided NLOS mitigation methods using 3D LiDAR, which reconstructs environments to improve GNSS accuracy. This research, recognized with the Best Presentation Award by industry leaders from Waymo and Swift Navigation, has been successfully applied in high-accuracy offline mapping. Dr. Wen will also explore recent advancements in extending these methods to GNSS Real-time Kinematic (RTK) systems, achieving sub-meter accuracy. This lecture will provide valuable insights into overcoming urban navigation challenges and the future of intelligent transportation systems.
