The trend of digital transformation in the supply chain cannot be ignored to enhance operational efficiency and keep pace with the times, in order to improve the efficiency of Hong Kong’s logistics industry and enterprise operations, and maintain international competitiveness.
Organized by the Hong Kong Shippers’ Committee, with the Productivity Council serving as the executing agency and supported by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government’s Industry and Trade Department’s “Support Fund”, the “Promoting the Implementation of Digital Transformation Execution Capability in the Logistics Industry and Hong Kong Small and Medium-sized Enterprises” will hold the following themed seminars related to supply chain digital transformation and logistics development.
The seminar will focus on the recent hot topic of “low-altitude economy,” deeply analyze its market potential, and explore how the logistics and transportation industries can use the latest aviation technologies, such as drones and unmanned vehicles, to disrupt traditional transportation modes and achieve digital transformation of drone logistics.
 The seminar will also deconstruct the elements of developing a low-altitude economy and the technological application of drones in new energy.
