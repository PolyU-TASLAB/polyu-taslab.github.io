## Messe Frankfurt Representatives Visit TAS-Lab

**Hong Kong – June 17, 2025** – The TAS-Lab was pleased to welcome Mr. Georg Alles and Ms. Wendy Tse, representatives from the esteemed Messe Frankfurt, for a visit this afternoon.

The visit began with a tour of the drone laboratory in Block FJ, led by our group member, Mr. Yingming Chen. He showcased the lab's facilities and presented the first-generation prototype of our autonomous cleaning drone, a highlight of our current research projects.

Following the tour, a productive meeting was held to explore potential synergies. Dr. Lu Bai, Mr. Yingming Chen, and Mr. Xiangru Wang provided an overview of the TAS-Lab's core research interests and significant past achievements.

In return, Mr. Alles and Ms. Tse introduced their major upcoming exhibition, **Aero Asia 2025**. They proposed the valuable addition of a dedicated academic session to the event, creating a platform to feature cutting-edge research. They also emphasized that the exhibition's career session would offer an excellent opportunity for students in aeronautics and aviation to connect with industry leaders and learn about future career pathways.

The meeting concluded with a shared enthusiasm for future collaborations between the TAS-Lab and Messe Frankfurt.
