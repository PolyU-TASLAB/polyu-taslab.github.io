### Advancing UAV Applications in Hong Kong

The UAV is the product of this collaboration with the Gammon Construction Ltd., represents an important step in advancing the in field application of our airblower UAV system at the newly built T2 airport. The demonstration provided a practical example of how this technology can be used in real-world scenarios and helped to build regulatory understanding and acceptance of specialized UAV applications in Hong Kong. The demonstration provided valuable insights into the operational parameters and safety considerations of airblower UAV technology.

Our team remains committed to working closely with aviation authorities to ensure that innovative UAV solutions can be safely integrated into Hong Kong's airspace, contributing to the development of the city's low-altitude economy.
