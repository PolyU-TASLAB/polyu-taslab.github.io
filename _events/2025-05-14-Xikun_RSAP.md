## Ph.D. Candidate Xikun Liu Visits the University of California, Los Angeles for Collaborative Research on Intelligent Planning for Disaster-Relief Robotics

Ph.D. Candidate Xikun Liu from TASLAB has commenced an academic visit to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Engineering in Spring 2025. He is conducting joint research under the supervision of Professor Sriram Narasimhan.

During the visit, he will focus on intelligent autonomous planning for ground robots in disaster-relief scenarios. The research addresses key challenges in robotic perception and decision-making in complex and dynamic environments. By integrating techniques such as deep learning and multi-sensor fusion, the project aims to enhance robotic autonomy and efficiency in post-disaster response missions, contributing to the development of intelligent urban emergency systems.

This visit lays a solid foundation for continued academic exchange and collaboration between the groups. Both sides look forward to exploring long-term research partnerships and advancing the frontiers of intelligent robotics.
