The visit brought together TAS team members with LINXAI's engineering experts. Discussions focused on four innovative projects aimed at enhancing the capabilities of the quadruped robot:
1. Robot Dog Following: Utilizing Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology for precise human-following, enabling applications in logistics, security, and personal assistance.
2. Robot Dog Vision-Based Motion Control: Integrating LiDAR sensors and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to improve terrain adaptability and gait optimization on unstructured surfaces.
3. Guide Dog Application: Developing an intelligent system for visually impaired users, combining localization, vision-language navigation, and locomotion modules for safe mobility assistance.
4. UAV-Robot Dog Landing: Creating an air-ground collaborative logistics system for seamless package transfer between UAVs and the quadruped robot, addressing last-mile delivery challenges.
These projects demonstrate the platform's potential in diverse fields, ranging from disaster response and industrial inspection to assistive technologies and smart logistics.
