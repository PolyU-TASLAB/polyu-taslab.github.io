We are pleased to share that on March 27, 2025, our postdoctoral fellow, Dr. BAI Shiyu, representing the TAS Lab, delivered a talk at the Satellite Navigation 2025 – International Workshop for Young Scientists, held at Beihang University. He presented on Indoor Semantic Mapping and Localization Method Based On Inertial-Only Perception, highlighting TAS Lab’s research on academic indoor pedestrian localization.


## Indoor Semantic Mapping and Localization Method Based On Inertial-Only Perception

An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is often used as a small component within an integrated navigation system. In most cases, the IMU serves as an auxiliary tool to enhance the accuracy of external sensors. In other words, the positioning results primarily rely on external sensors. However, if the external sensors fail, the entire navigation system may fail as well, since low-cost IMUs cannot be used independently due to their rapid error drift. In our research, we aim to push the boundaries of IMU-based localization. By leveraging motion features and deep learning techniques, we have developed an indoor semantic mapping and localization method based on inertial-only perception. Additionally, in collaboration with Honor Company, we are exploring smartwatch-based inertial odometry, which is particularly challenging in real-world scenarios due to the vigorous movements associated with human-body motion.
