# TASLab’s Medical Delivery Drone Project Showcased at HK SciFest, Featured by RTHK Pioneering UAV Technology for Emergency Healthcare Logistics

**HONG KONG, April 2025** — The **Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Lab (TAS Lab)** at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University demonstrated its **life-saving Medical Delivery Drone System** at the **Hong Kong Science Festival (HK SciFest)**, drawing significant public and media attention. The project was spotlighted in an exclusive interview by **Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK)**, highlighting its potential to transform emergency medical supply chains in remote and urban areas.

# Revolutionizing Healthcare Logistics
The drone system, developed under TASLab’s **Low-altitude Economy (LAE)** Regulatory Sandbox trials, is designed to deliver critical medical payloads—such as vaccines, blood samples, and emergency medications—to hospitals, clinics, and disaster zones with unprecedented speed and reliability. Cooperating with the **Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (Astri)**, TASLab will deploy the Medical Delivery Drone System along with the **Smart Traffic Light** Project developed with Astri to realize the exact harmony of infrastructures development with smart city applications. 

The Smart Traffic Light System can functioning as a fixed charging station to collect and recharge the off-shift drone, greatly increase the sustainability of the medical delivery drone and its operating range.
