##Discussion over the LAE development in Hong Kong with CTO of the SFexpress Hong Kong, Kenny Lau at Hong Kong Polytechnic University - TASLab on Mar 14th,2025

The Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Laboratory (TASLab) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is honored to welcome Mr. Kenny Lau, Chief Technology Officer of S.F. Express Hong Kong, for a strategic visit on Mar 14th,2025. This high-level engagement will focus on advancing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technologies and accelerating the development of Hong Kong’s low-altitude economy—a transformative sector poised to redefine urban logistics, emergency response, and regional connectivity.

Dr. Wen Weisong, Administrative Supervisor of TASBLab, organized this progressive discussion with Mr. Lau.

This discussion focuses on three main topics:

-UAV Innovations: Progress in drone delivery systems, autonomous navigation, and AI-driven airspace management.

-Low-Altitude Economy: Opportunities for Hong Kong to pioneer smart air mobility infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and cross-sector partnerships.

-Sustainability & Safety: Balancing technological growth with environmental and operational safeguard policies.

The discussion has deeply thrived in the inspection sights of the participants, and has emerged meaningful thoughts over the low-altitude economy affected industries.

  Dr. Wen Weisong is exchanging opinions about the low-altitude economy policies with Mr. Kenny Lau.
</div>

As a global logistics hub, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to lead the low-altitude economy—a burgeoning sector projected to unlock billions in economic value through aerial logistics, surveillance, and passenger transport. SF Express, a pioneer in drone delivery trials across Greater China, brings critical industry insights, while PolyU TASLab’s cutting-edge research in aeronautical systems provides the technical backbone for scalable solutions.

We wish to see further information exchange in the progressive trail and look forward to committing to a closer collaboration relationship with S.F. Express.
