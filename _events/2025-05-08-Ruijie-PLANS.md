## Ph.D. Student XU Ruijie Presents Novel Wi-Fi RTT/LiDAR/IMU Integration Framework at IEEE/ION PLANS 2025

From April 28 to May 1, 2025, PhD student Ruijie Xu from TASLAB attended the prestigious IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS) in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. At this leading conference for positioning, navigation, and timing technologies, Xu presented innovative research titled *Tightly-Coupled Wi-Fi/LiDAR/Inertial Integration via Factor Graph Optimization for UAS.*

The presented work addresses critical challenges of positioning in outdoor-indoor transition scenarios for Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) by introducing a novel tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion framework via FGO, implementing comprehensive integration of Wi-Fi Round-Trip-Time (RTT), LiDAR, and inertial measurements at the raw data level within a unified factor graph optimization framework. The proposed approach employs fault detection exclusion method to effectively handle both RTT measurement anomalies and LiDAR-inertial odometry drift. Experimental results demonstrated remarkable positioning accuracy in controlled indoor and challenging outdoor environments, respectivelyâ€”representing substantial improvements over both conventional Wi-Fi RTT positioning and traditional LiDAR-inertial odometry.
