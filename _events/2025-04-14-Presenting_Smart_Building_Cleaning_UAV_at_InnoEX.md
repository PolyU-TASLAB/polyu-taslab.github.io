# Presenting Smart Building Cleaning UAV System at InnoEX 2025 to Jiangsu Enterprises

**HONG KONG, April 2025** — Our Lab, the **Trustworthy Autonomous System (TAS) Lab** at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, unveiled its groundbreaking **Smart Building Cleaning UAV System at InnoEX 2025**, Asia’s premier innovation and technology expo on April 14th, 2025. The system, demonstrated to a delegation of enterprise leaders from **Jiangsu Province**, China, promises to revolutionize high-rise building maintenance through autonomous aerial robotics, aligning with national goals for smart city development and low-altitude economy growth.

This approval enables TAS Lab to conduct a series of real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trials across critical zones in Hong Kong, positioning the lab at the forefront of **aerial robotics, low-altitude applications, and smart city integration**.

## Key Features and Demonstration

The system showcased at InnoEX 2025 includes:

-**AI-Powered Navigation**: SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) technology for obstacle avoidance in complex urban terrain.

-**Adaptive Cleaning Modules**: Water-efficient, chemical-free spray systems adjustable for glass, concrete, and solar panels.

-**Real-Time Structural Health Monitoring**: Onboard sensors detect cracks, corrosion, or thermal leaks, transmitting data to facility managers.

-**Low-Altitude Compliance**: Operates within Hong Kong’s 300-foot AGL regulatory framework, validated through the LAE Regulatory Sandbox.

## Strategic Interest from Jiangsu Enterprises

Jiangsu, home to over 60% of China’s skyscrapers above 200 meters, represents a key market for the technology. During the event, Nanjing Smart City Group and Suzhou Industrial Park Authority expressed intent to pilot the system for maintaining commercial towers and industrial facilities.

Mr. Wei Zhang, CEO of Nanjing Smart City Group, remarked:

> *"Hong Kong’s expertise in autonomous systems complements Jiangsu’s infrastructure needs. This UAV solution could reduce rooftop maintenance costs by 40% while enhancing worker safety—a win for our ESG goals."*

## Next Steps: Cross-Boundary Collaboration

Building on the LAE Sandbox trials, TAS Lab plans:

-**Joint Pilots**: Deploy UAVs in Jiangsu’s Nanjing CBD and Suzhou Industrial Park in Q1 2026.

-**Regulatory Alignment**: Work with Mainland authorities to harmonize UAV operations across the Greater Bay Area.

-**AI Expansion**: Integrate generative AI for predictive maintenance scheduling based on sensor data.
<!-- ## Project Scope and Locations

The approved project runs from **January 2 to December 30, 2025**, and includes UAV operations at:

- **Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks (HKSTP)**
- **Gleneagles Hospital Hong Kong (GHK)**
- **Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park (HSITP)**

These locations were chosen for their strategic importance in innovation, healthcare logistics, and cross-boundary technological collaboration. All operations will be conducted within the regulatory limit of **300 feet above ground level (AGL)** and under strict safety protocols. -->

### Flight route 

- **Trial 1**: [HKSTP](https://maps.app.goo.gl/29PSaCwyMyyXfcjz6) ↔ [Tai Po InnoPark Vertiport](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xZB2bAZR3RQAAWDu6)  
- **Trial 2**: [GHK](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8znQBu2QMD8pkqMP7) ↔ [Wong Nai Chung Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bpxcnHbtMuAJSjTNA)  
- **Trial 3**: [HSITP](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w7LWf6cKMYUqPtpC7) -->

<!-- ## Objectives and Contributions

The project is designed to demonstrate the safe, scalable, and innovative use of UAVs in real-world urban settings. Core objectives include:

- Showcasing **autonomous logistics and aerial inspection** capabilities.
- Evaluating **communication resilience**, including C2 (command and control) link latency and geo-fencing.
- Generating critical data for the **design of UAV flight corridors**, operational parameters, and emergency response strategies.
- Informing future **regulatory guidelines and airspace management frameworks** for Hong Kong’s LAE development.

TAS Lab will contribute essential knowledge to the development of Hong Kong’s **next-generation aerial infrastructure** while advancing the city’s leadership in smart mobility and aviation research.

## Safety Requirements of Operation

The trial operations will involve the following parameters:

- **Operational Scope**:
  - All flights will operate under **Visual Line of Sight (VLOS)** to ensure maximum safety and regulatory compliance.
  - Each UAV will carry a payload of approximately **3 kg**, with the total operational weight reaching **11.4 kg**, qualifying under the Advanced Operations Permission category.
  - Operations over water will involve **boat rental** to ensure retrieval and emergency recovery protocols are in place.

- **Safety System Usage**:
  - Integration of **camera and LiDAR sensors** for environmental perception, SLAM-based mapping, and collision avoidance.
  - Implementation of a **backend surveillance system** to monitor UAV telemetry, geo-location, and system logs in real time.
  - Emergency protocols include autonomous **Return-to-Home (RTH)** and **Failsafe mechanisms**.

## Trial Phases and Methodology

The 12-month project will unfold in four main phases:

1. **System Calibration and On-site Assessment**  
   Site surveys, geo-fencing configuration, and signal latency validation.

2. **Scenario-based Trials**  
   Executing use cases involving healthcare logistics, smart inspection, and route network testing.

3. **Data Logging and Safety Evaluation**  
   Capturing flight logs, safety event reports, and environmental performance metrics.

4. **Policy Feedback and Optimization**  
   Sharing trial insights with regulators to refine Hong Kong’s UAV regulations and urban airspace design.

## Shaping the Future of Smart Urban Skies

TAS Lab is proud to contribute to this pivotal national initiative that merges **academic research**, **industrial implementation**, and **policy shaping**. As Hong Kong sets its sights on becoming a regional leader in the **low-altitude economy**, projects like this will lay the groundwork for a sustainable and intelligent "smart sky" ecosystem.
