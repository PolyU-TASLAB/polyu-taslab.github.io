Opening and closing remarks were delivered by Prof. Weisong Wen, setting the tone for a series of insightful talks. Key academic contributions included:

- Prof. Shan Jinjun (York University) on adaptive decision-making in autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning and game theory.

- Prof. Gao Fei (Zhejiang University) on algorithms for drone swarms in complex environments.

- Prof. Meng Qian (Southeast University) on the reliability of autonomous navigation systems.

- Prof. Sun Chao (Beihang University) on interpretable AI for detecting deceptive interference.

Industry-focused presentations showcased real-world AI applications:

- Mr. Hong Gang (Cloud Factory Technology) on smart road management through AI-enabled edge computing.

- Mr. Li Yutao (Hanhe Aviation) on drones transforming rice farming and industrial cleaning.

- Mr. Xiao Kai (LINXAI) on commercializing humanoid robots.

- Mr. Dylan Tyack (Drone Solutions Asia) on AI-driven drone cleaning for urban safety.

- Mr. Chen Hang (ASTRI) on the fusion of AI, connected driving, and the low-altitude economy.

The forum attracted high engagement: physical attendance exceeded capacity, and over 2,300 tuned in online, with strong viewership from young and urban audiences.

Looking ahead, the sub-forum aims to deepen AI research, promote cross-industry innovation, support talent development, and strengthen global collaboration in intelligent systems and low-altitude technologies.
