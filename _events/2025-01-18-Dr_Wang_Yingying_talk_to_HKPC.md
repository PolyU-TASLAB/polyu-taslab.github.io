We are pleased to share that on January 18, 2025, our postdoc fellow WANG, Yingying, representing the TAS LAB, gave a talk at Shanghai Jiaotong University invited by the Institute for Sensing and Navigation. She shared non-intrusive pedestrian indoor localization research from the perspective of IMU and WiFi, especially the academic indoor pedestrian localization research in TAS LAB.


## Non-intrusive Pedestrian Indoor Localization, From the perspective of IMU & WiFi

Low-cost, unobtrusive, and non-intrusive sensing for indoor pedestrian localization has been a research hotspot for decades. However, there is still no universal indoor localization solution that can be employed effectively without dedicated hardware. The high research interest in smartphone-based indoor localization is driven by the proliferation of embedded sensors, which provide an array of candidates that can be utilized in indoor localization. This talk will focus on two non-intrusive sensing modalities, inertial measurement unit and WiFi received signal strength indicator (RSSI). How deep learning techniques can improve the localization accuracy and robustness of these two localization modalities is illustrated.
