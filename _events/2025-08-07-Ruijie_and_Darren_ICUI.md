On August 7th, 2025, with the help of Prof. Wen, **PhD student Ruijie Xu and Dr. Feng Huang** successfully organized the special session **“Urban Navigation and Sensing for Next-Generation Smart Cities”** as part of *the Global Smart Cities Summit cum The 4th International Conference on Urban Informatics (GSCS & ICUI 2025)*. This special session was dedicated to exploring cutting-edge advances in urban navigation and sensing technologies, aiming to address the challenges of accurate localization, seamless mobility, and intelligent sensing in increasingly complex urban environments.

The session attracted leading researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry, fostering in-depth discussions on leveraging GNSS, LiDAR, Wi-Fi, and multi-sensor fusion in next-generation smart cities. The event received enthusiastic feedback and sparked insightful exchanges among participants.

During the session, **Dr. Guohao Zhang** was invited to present his work on “Urban Sensing using GNSS Signals – Potentials and Outlooks,” sharing the latest developments and future prospects of GNSS-based urban sensing technologies.
