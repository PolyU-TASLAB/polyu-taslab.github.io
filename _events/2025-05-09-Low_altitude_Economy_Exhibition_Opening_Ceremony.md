# Government and Industry Leaders Emphasize LAE’s Potential

In his opening remarks, **Mr. John Lee, Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR**, highlighted the city’s commitment to integrating low-altitude technologies into its **Smart City Blueprint 3.0**:

> *"Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to lead in low-altitude applications, from logistics to infrastructure inspection. The LAE Regulatory Sandbox has already enabled successful trials, and this exhibition accelerates our vision for a connected, automated urban sky."*

# Key Themes and Future Collaborations
The exhibition explores four core themes:

**Urban Air Mobility (UAM)**: eVTOLs and drone taxis for future transport.

**Smart Logistics**: Last-mile and cross-border UAV delivery networks.

**Infrastructure Inspection**: AI-driven drones for bridges, buildings, and utilities.

**Policy & Regulation**: Harmonizing airspace management across the Greater Bay Area.

# What’s Next?
With over 50 exhibitors and 5,000+ attendees expected, the LAE Exhibition 2025 sets the stage for Hong Kong’s Low-altitude Economy Master Plan, due for release later this year. A live flight demo zone at Cyberport will run daily, allowing visitors to witness UAVs in action.
