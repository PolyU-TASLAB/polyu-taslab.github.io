# Cross-Boundary Knowledge Sharing on UAV-Enabled Inspection Technologies
On **April 28, 2025**, The Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Lab (TAS Lab) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University hosted an information exchange session with the **Zhejiang Handover and Maintenance Engineering Branch Company** and PolyU’s Department of **Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)**, fostering dialogue on integrating autonomous UAV systems into next-generation infrastructure maintenance.

Upon arrival, the UAV team engaged in close discussions with members of TAS Lab, covering a wide range of topics including UAV applications in urban environments, system design, and operational safety.

# Bridging Research and Industry Needs
The meeting focused on leveraging TAS Lab’s **Aerial Robotics** research to bridge the gap between academia and industry. The Zhejiang engineering group, a leading provider of infrastructure maintenance services in China, was invited to share their experiences with integrating UAVs into their operations.
aerial robotics expertise to address challenges in large-scale infrastructure inspection and maintenance, a core competency of the Zhejiang engineering group. Key discussion points included:

**AI-powered UAV inspection systems** for bridges, highways, and smart city assets.

**Predictive maintenance algorithms** using drone-collected sensor data (LiDAR, thermal imaging).

**Regulatory synergies** between Hong Kong’s LAE sandbox and mainland China’s UAV operation frameworks.

# Academic-Industry Synergy
The CEE Department highlighted complementary research in:

-- **Smart City** and **smart infrastructure**, with a focus on smart city asset management, including:
- **Smart bridge** and **smart highway**, with a focus on smart asset management, including:
    -   Bridge condition monitoring and maintenance. 
    -   Structural health monitoring via drone-mounted sensors.   
-- **Digital twin integration** for real-time asset management.
