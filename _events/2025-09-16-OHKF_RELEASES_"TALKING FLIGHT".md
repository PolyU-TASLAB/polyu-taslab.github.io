### Team Support and Key Discussion Points

As a supporting team for this report, we conducted in-depth discussions focusing on the following key issues:

1. The government support needed by university research teams, such as the Civil Aviation Department's review and support for research drone test flights;
2. The critical breakthroughs required for transforming low-altitude technology research achievements into industrial applications in Hong Kong;
3. How to strengthen collaboration between academia and industry to bring economic benefits to Hong Kong;
4. How Hong Kong can synergize with Mainland China's low-altitude economy industry during the development process.

### Academic and Industry Exchange

At the same time, we invited researchers from Our Hong Kong Foundation (OHKF) to visit The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and participate in several academic and industry sharing and discussion sessions.
