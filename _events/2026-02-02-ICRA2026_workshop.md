We’re organizing the 1st Workshop on Robot Meets GNSS and Ranging for Seamless Autonomy, happening on Friday, June 5, 2026 in Vienna.
If you work on reliable autonomy in the real world—especially where GNSS/UWB/ranging gets messy—this workshop is for you. You can find more details from the [workshop page](https://robotmeetsranging.tech/)

Recognizing shared challenges in sensor integration, error modeling, integrity monitoring, and certifiable optimization of ranging observations from diverse systems (e.g., GNSS, Ultra-Wideband), this event emphasizes the critical role of ranging technologies in resilient robot navigation. It aims to identify open problems and promising research directions across domains, bringing together researchers from diverse communities to exchange knowledge and foster collaboration.

TAS Lab remains at the forefront of research dedicated to creating safer, more efficient, and intelligent robotics solutions for the future.
