##  PolyU Trustworthy Autonomous System Lab Member Attends Landmark Guangdong-Hong Kong Low-Altitude Economy Industry Exchange Conference

*Hong Kong, June 30, 2025* – As a representative of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) Trustworthy Autonomous System Lab, I was invited to attend the Guangdong-Hong Kong Low-Altitude Economy Industry Exchange Conference held today in Hong Kong. The event, hosted by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Commerce’s Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, brought together government officials, industry leaders, and innovators to explore collaborative opportunities in the rapidly evolving low-altitude economy sector.

#### Keynote Speeches Highlight Cross-Border Collaboration
The conference opened with remarks from **Mr. Zhu Xiaojun**, Deputy Director-General of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Commerce, who emphasized Guangdong’s commitment to fostering innovation in low-altitude applications, including drone logistics, urban air mobility (UAM), and autonomous systems. **Dr. Elizabeth Quat**, Legislative Council Member and Founding President of the Greater Bay Area Low-Altitude Economy Alliance, underscored Hong Kong’s role as an international hub for technological and regulatory advancements in this field.

#### Policy Insights and Municipal Investment Opportunities
**Mr. Lin Zhichun**, Head of the Guangdong Low-Altitude Economy Task Force, delivered a policy briefing outlining regulatory frameworks and incentives to accelerate industry growth. Representatives from Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai further presented their cities’ strategic advantages in low-altitude technology investment, highlighting infrastructure, talent pools, and pilot programs.

#### PolyU’s Role in the Low-Altitude Ecosystem
As a member of PolyU’s Trustworthy Autonomous System Lab, I observed strong synergies between the conference’s themes and our lab’s work on safety, reliability, and AI ethics in autonomous aviation. The event reinforced the potential for Hong Kong’s academic institutions to partner with mainland counterparts in R&D and commercialization, particularly in UAM and cross-border regulatory sandboxes.

The conference concluded with a networking session, where I connected with industry stakeholders to explore collaborative R&D and talent exchange initiatives. With the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area positioning itself as a global leader in low-altitude innovation, PolyU’s expertise in autonomous systems is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping this emerging sector.
