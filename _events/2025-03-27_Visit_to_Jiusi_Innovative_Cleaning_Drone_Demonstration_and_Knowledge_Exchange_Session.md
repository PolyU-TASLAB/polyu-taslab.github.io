##  Visit to Jiusi's Innovative Cleaning Drone Demonstration and Knowledge Exchange Session
### Academic-Industry Collaboration Explores Future of Smart City Maintenance

#### Demonstration of D15R Facade Cleaning Drone
The Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Laboratory (TASLAB) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today paid a visit to JIUSI Intelligent Aviation Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., a leading provider of autonomous drones for smart city maintenance, highlighted by an impressive demonstration of Jiusi's next-generation facade cleaning drone.

Jiusi adopted two RTK anttana solution to secure the accurate positioning of the drone, ensuring accurate and precise operations. Featuring uniquely designed interchangeable nozzles, Jiusi's cleaning drone accomplishes wall surface cleaning through two optimized missions: During the first flight, a cavity nozzle generates adhesive foam to fix the cleaning solution onto glass curtain walls, allowing sufficient time for the solution to react with and degrade stubborn stains. The second mission employs a high-pressure nozzle to spray plasma-enhanced water, effectively removing residual contaminants while minimizing water streaks on the curtain wall surface through precision rinsing.The facade cleaning drone has showed a remarkable stability and efficiency in cleaning performance. According to the pilot, the drone can clean 500 meters square per hour.



#### Knowledge Exchange Session
Although the drone has demonstrated its stability and efficiency in cleaning performance, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed for the drone to fully realize its potential in the real world. These include:
-The challenge of accurate positioning when drone is approaching the facades.
-The need for optimizing the cleaning and fail-safe strategies.

As we have learnt from discussion with the techinical manager of Jiusi, the current cleaning module of Jiusi cleaning drone tolerates a minimum error of 0.5 meters. The root cause of this error comes from the limitation of applying mmWave Radar, which is limited by the size of the antenna. Jiusi engineers is trying to optimize the antenna design and improve its performance, aiming to achieve an error of 0.2 meters when approaching the facade.
Jiusi has put their future focus on optimizing the cleaning strategy for the drone. Shared by their leader of the development team, the goal is to achieve autnomous rotation when the cleaning route reaches the edges of the building to optimize the cleaning efficiency.

The visit and knowledge exchange session with Jiusi was held was a fruitful discussion about the current cleaning module of Jiusi cleaning drone, its limitations, and future plans for optimization.
