### Morning session

The workshop began with Prof. Wen Chih-Yung, Director of RCUAS, welcoming all participants. He highlighted the Centre’s mission to drive innovation in unmanned systems through interdisciplinary research and international collaboration. Prof. Wen outlined key achievements of RCUAS and encouraged attendees to actively exchange ideas to shape the future of trustworthy autonomous technologies. Prof. Zhou Yi (Professor at School of Robotics, Hunan University (HNU)) presented how neuromorphic event-based vision enables safer and faster mobile robots through high-speed, low-latency perception. Prof. Wang Bing (Assistant Professor at AAE, PolyU) introduced Ocean Spatial Intelligence, showcasing multi-modal underwater scene modeling and uncertainty-aware SLAM for robust marine robotics. Mr. Chan Yin Yuen, on behalf of Prof. Ng Kam Hung (Associate Professor at AAE, PolyU), shared an automated UAV-based aircraft inspection system combining 3D LiDAR SLAM and deep learning for precise defect detection. Prof. Huang Hailong (Assistant Professor at AAE, PolyU) discussed advanced algorithms for fast and safe UAV flight using convexification techniques. Dr Li Boyang (Lecturer in aerospace systems engineering at the School of Engineering, University of Newcastle) presented on integrating UAS into teaching and research in Australia and offered a comparative view on engineering education. relevant to aerospace applications. The meeting concluded with a mutual enthusiasm for future joint projects.

### Afternoon session

The afternoon session of the RCUAS workshop continued to showcase cutting-edge research and international collaboration in the field of unmanned systems. Dr Hu Wenbo, on behalf of Prof. Dong You (Associate Professor of Intelligent Maintenance at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, PolyU), began the session by introducing an AI-assisted UAV system for bridge defect detection and digital perception, demonstrating lightweight crack segmentation and advanced point cloud processing validated through real-world deployments. Prof. Wang Chaoqun (Professor with the School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University) shared insights on embodied perception and navigation, highlighting how intelligent interaction with complex environments advances autonomous capabilities. Dr Chu Xiangyu (Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)) presented innovative morphological designs and motor intelligence strategies to achieve embodied agility in autonomous systems, with applications ranging from hopping robots to transformable platforms for diverse terrain. After a short break, Dr Tim Pfeifer (Siemens AG) discussed industrial indoor localization, bridging practical deployment and academic research while exploring the potential of Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and 5G for large-scale, real-time tracking. The workshop concluded with an open discussion moderated through key issues on ensuring trustworthy AI and robust autonomy, drawing connections across the day’s presentations. Prof. Wen Weisong delivered closing statements, thanking all speakers and participants for contributing to a fruitful exchange of ideas and future directions for unmanned autonomous systems.
