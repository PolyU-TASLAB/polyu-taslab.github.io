## Ph.D. Student Runzhi Begins Research Attachment at University of New South Wales Under Leading GNSS Expert  

Ph.D. candidate Runzhi has started a Research Student Attachment Programme at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), supervised by Prof. Jinling Wang, a globally recognized authority in precise GNSS positioning and stochastic modeling.  

The collaboration began with an inaugural meeting on April 7th, where the pair explored innovative approaches to GNSS measurement challenges. Their discussion centered on integrating deep learning techniques with traditional stochastic modeling, a field historically dominated by classical statistical analysis. Prof. Wang highlighted the transformative potential of data-driven methods, acknowledging that machine learning could revolutionize how stochastic models are developed and refined in GNSS applications.  

This partnership marks a forward-looking step in bridging cutting-edge AI technologies with satellite positioning research. Both parties expressed enthusiasm for sustained collaboration, aiming to advance precision and reliability in GNSS systems through interdisciplinary innovation.
