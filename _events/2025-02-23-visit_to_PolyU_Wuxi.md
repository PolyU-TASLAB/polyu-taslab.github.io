## Dr. Wen presented TAS Lab Research on LAE for HKGCC members on Feb 18, 2025

Dr LAM Tai-fai  the Chairman of Hong Kong Polytechnic University Council Membership and Ir Professor H.C. Man, the Dean of Faculty of Engineering concluded an insightful visit to the Hong Kong Polytechnic  University - Wuxi Technology and Innovation Research Institute on Feb 23, 2025.

Dr. Wen Weisong, Director of the Institute's Intelligent Transportation & Unmanned Systems Center, led the delegation on a tour of the Intelligent Transportation & Unmanned Systems Center.

Dr. Wen introduced them to the Intelligent Transportation Unmanned Systems Center, where they delved into the latest advancements in cutting-edge technologies. The visitors were captivated by the multi-rotor building cleaning dronesâ€”innovative devices poised to revolutionize the maintenance of high-rise exteriors by providing efficient and safe cleaning solutions. They also explored the beyond-visual-range cargo drones, advanced unmanned aerial vehicles capable of transporting goods over long distances without the need for direct visual contact, signaling a new era in logistics and delivery services.

The center also exhibits portable handheld data mapping equipment capable of collecting data and mapping in real time on different terrains. The technology promises major advances in areas such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. In addition, the integrated communication, navigation and control board, a complex fusion of key functions essential for unmanned systems, is demonstrated, simplified into a single, efficient unit.

A key highlight was the demonstration of an autonomous driving vehicle. This self-driving car exemplifies the institute's strides in intelligent transportation, showcasing sophisticated algorithms and sensor technologies that enable safe and efficient navigation without human intervention. Another highlight was the introduction to humanoid robots engineered to mimic human movements and interactions. These robots hold immense potential in service industries and complex operational tasks, indicating a future where automation and human-like robotics collaborate seamlessly.

The visit underscored the institute's robust collaborations with local enterprises in Wuxi. Dr. Wen explained how these partnerships bridge academic research with practical industry applications, fostering innovation and driving economic growth in the region. The Chairman and Professor Man expressed appreciation for these collaborative efforts, noting their importance in advancing technological development and benefiting the broader community.
