The collaboration is centered on the "UAV-based Blade and Tower Inspection" project, operating under the Guangdong-Hong Kong Joint Laboratory for Marine Infrastructure. The project aims to develop efficient, drone-based technologies for inspecting offshore wind turbines. The Hong Kong research efforts are led by Principal Investigator Dr. Wen Weisong, in partnership with his Guangdong counterpart, Lin Jinghua of the China Energy Engineering Group Guangdong Electric Power Design Institute Co., Ltd.. This collaboration also aims to jointly publish at least two academic papers, apply for one or more invention patents, and cultivate postgraduate talent.
