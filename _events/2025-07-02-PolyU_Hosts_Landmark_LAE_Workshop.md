## PolyU Hosts Landmark Low Altitude Economy (LAE) Workshop, Paving the Way for Hong Kong’s Drone Innovation

*Hong Kong, 2 July 2025* – The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) convened industry leaders, researchers, and policymakers for a pivotal LAE Sandbox Workshop and Public Seminar, spotlighting Hong Kong’s ambitions to become a hub for drone technology and low-altitude economic development.

## Key Discussions & Outcomes
### 1.	Sandbox Progress & Challenges:
o	38 projects are currently under Hong Kong’s LAE Sandbox Regulation, though only several flight performances have been fully implemented.
o	Regulatory hurdles: Delays in AOP (Advance Operation Permit) approvals and cross-border policy misalignment (e.g., differing drone definitions, customs rules) were highlighted as critical barriers.
o	Collaborative solutions: Proposals included redefining logistics drones as "flying trucks" for smoother customs clearance (inspired by DJI) and prioritizing "from suburbs to cities, goods to people" for phased regulation.

### 2.	Industry Innovations:
o	**SF Express (丰翼)**: Revealed plans for **heavy-duty drone (25kg+)** trials by mid-July, with existing success in blood sample deliveries (7,000+ flights in Shenzhen).
o	**Cross-border logistics**: A PolyU-backed project with **Shenzhen Urban Transport Planning Center (SUTPC)** aims to slash delivery times by 80–90% between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
o	**eVTOL advancements**: Companies like **Aerofugia** and **Zero Gravity** showcased electric vertical take-off aircraft, targeting 2026 for passenger trials.

### 3.	Public Seminar Highlights:
o	**Safety & Infrastructure**: Experts stressed the need for **vertiports** (22.5–30m diameter) and anti-drone systems (e.g., radar-based "black drone" detection by Beijing Racobit).
o	**Digital Integration**: **ASTRI** and **Gaode Map** proposed unified low-altitude traffic management platforms, piloted in Shenzhen’s Longgang District.

## Quotable Insights
•	**Kenny Lau (CTO, S.F. Express)**: *"Hong Kong is in the 0-to-1 phase. Scalability hinges on cross-border networks—flying from Tsing Yi to Shenzhen, not just islands."*
•	**Cheng Xue (LAE Solution Manager, SUTPC Representative)**: *"Commercial viability must drive sandbox projects. Round 1 lacked market focus; Round 2 needs tighter industry-government synergy."*

## Path Forward
•	**Standardized regulations** and faster AOP processing.
•	**Public-private pilots**: E.g., medical deliveries to outlying islands (Digital Port to Lamma/Cheung Chau).
•	Lab visits at PolyU’s FJ005 facility showcased prototypes like handheld mapping devices and "all-in-one" navigation systems.
