HONG KONG – November 3, 2025 – The TAS Lab from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) presented its cutting-edge unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology at a special exhibition during the annual dinner of The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) Asian Pacific Branch.

The event, attended by key figures and professionals from the housing and property management industry, provided a prime opportunity for the PolyU research team to demonstrate the practical applications of their advanced drone systems.

The TAS Lab's exhibition featured video presentations and our drone models WALL-E, highlighting capabilities specifically relevant to the housing sector. These included high-precision autonomous navigation for façade cleaning, AI-powered defect detection, and 3D mapping for building maintenance.

The demonstration sparked significant interest among the attendees, fostering discussions on how this technology could be integrated into existing workflows for building surveys, maintenance planning, and safety compliance.
