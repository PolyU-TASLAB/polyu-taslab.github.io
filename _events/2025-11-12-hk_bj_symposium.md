HONG KONG – November 12, 2025 – The 28th Beijing-Hong Kong Economic Cooperation Symposium witnessed a showcase of technological innovation as Dr. Runqiu Yang and Mr. Zhongqi Wang from our research laboratory presented our work on quadruped robot. The robot is designed for inspection, logistics, and search-and-rescue operations, capable of carrying heavy loads for extended periods. The demonstration attracted substantial attention from government officials, industry leaders, and academic professionals.

The symposium, themed "Beijing-Hong Kong Joining Hands, Connecting the World," brought together over 800 participants from government agencies, international business associations, leading enterprises, and industrial professionals. The symposium's significance was underscored by the presence of key political leaders, with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive John Lee and Beijing Municipal Mayor Yin Yong both delivering addresses at the opening ceremony. The symposium served as a crucial bridge for strengthening ties between the two regions' technological ecosystems. As Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive John Lee noted in his opening address, "Beijing possesses profound historical culture and strong technological innovation capabilities, while Hong Kong enjoys the advantages of connecting the mainland with the rest of the world under the 'one country, two systems' framework."
