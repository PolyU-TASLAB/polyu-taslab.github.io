Their talks covered essential topics from high-precision multi-sensor fusion and radar-based navigation to formal safety methods and LiDAR-centric systems for drones.


A key highlight of the event was the dynamic poster session. Colleagues from our research group and Zhenxing Ming from University of Sydneey presented their latest findings, contributing significantly to the dialogue on next-generation intelligent vehicles. Their exhibited works covered areas such as robust localization, V2X data fusion, and integrity monitoring for autonomous navigation.


The 4th Workshop on Intelligent Vehicle Meets Urban was a resounding success, fostering collaboration and setting new directions for research in safe and certifiable autonomous systems. The organizing committee extends its sincere gratitude to all invited speakers, poster presenters, and attendees for their active participation.
