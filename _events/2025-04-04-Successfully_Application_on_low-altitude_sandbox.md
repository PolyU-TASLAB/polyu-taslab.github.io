# Successfully Application on Low-altitude Sandbox Project

**HONG KONG, April 2025** — Our Lab, the **Trustworthy Autonomous System (TAS) Lab** at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, has achieved a key milestone in advancing urban air mobility. In collaboration with **SUTPC Digital Technology (Hong Kong) Limited**, TAS Lab has secured formal approval for trial operations under the **Low-altitude Economy (LAE) Regulatory Sandbox**, an initiative led by the **Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB)** of the HKSAR Government.

This approval enables TAS Lab to conduct a series of real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trials across critical zones in Hong Kong, positioning the lab at the forefront of **aerial robotics, low-altitude applications, and smart city integration**.

## National Vision: A Smart Sky Economy

In a recent public address, **Chief Executive Mr. John Lee** emphasized the LAE as:

> *“One of our nation's strategic emerging industries, as well as the example in exploring new quality productive forces... It not only gives rise to a series of industries, but also brings along a very wide scope of application scenarios with tremendous potential. It is set to strengthen city management and business efficiency, and create a whole new experience of smart living for the public, making it an important growth engine for the economy.”*

Mr. Lee reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to developing Hong Kong into both an **international innovation and technology centre** and a **hub for high-calibre talent**, with the LAE serving as a crucial pillar in this transformation. TAS Lab’s project contributes directly to this forward-looking initiative by combining academic research with field application.

<!-- ## Project Scope and Locations

The approved project runs from **January 2 to December 30, 2025**, and includes UAV operations at:

- **Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks (HKSTP)**
- **Gleneagles Hospital Hong Kong (GHK)**
- **Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park (HSITP)**

These locations were chosen for their strategic importance in innovation, healthcare logistics, and cross-boundary technological collaboration. All operations will be conducted within the regulatory limit of **300 feet above ground level (AGL)** and under strict safety protocols. -->

### Flight route 

- **Trial 1**: [HKSTP](https://maps.app.goo.gl/29PSaCwyMyyXfcjz6) ↔ [Tai Po InnoPark Vertiport](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xZB2bAZR3RQAAWDu6)  
- **Trial 2**: [GHK](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8znQBu2QMD8pkqMP7) ↔ [Wong Nai Chung Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bpxcnHbtMuAJSjTNA)  
- **Trial 3**: [HSITP](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w7LWf6cKMYUqPtpC7) -->

<!-- ## Objectives and Contributions

The project is designed to demonstrate the safe, scalable, and innovative use of UAVs in real-world urban settings. Core objectives include:

- Showcasing **autonomous logistics and aerial inspection** capabilities.
- Evaluating **communication resilience**, including C2 (command and control) link latency and geo-fencing.
- Generating critical data for the **design of UAV flight corridors**, operational parameters, and emergency response strategies.
- Informing future **regulatory guidelines and airspace management frameworks** for Hong Kong’s LAE development.

TAS Lab will contribute essential knowledge to the development of Hong Kong’s **next-generation aerial infrastructure** while advancing the city’s leadership in smart mobility and aviation research.

## Safety Requirements of Operation

The trial operations will involve the following parameters:

- **Operational Scope**:
  - All flights will operate under **Visual Line of Sight (VLOS)** to ensure maximum safety and regulatory compliance.
  - Each UAV will carry a payload of approximately **3 kg**, with the total operational weight reaching **11.4 kg**, qualifying under the Advanced Operations Permission category.
  - Operations over water will involve **boat rental** to ensure retrieval and emergency recovery protocols are in place.

- **Safety System Usage**:
  - Integration of **camera and LiDAR sensors** for environmental perception, SLAM-based mapping, and collision avoidance.
  - Implementation of a **backend surveillance system** to monitor UAV telemetry, geo-location, and system logs in real time.
  - Emergency protocols include autonomous **Return-to-Home (RTH)** and **Failsafe mechanisms**.

## Trial Phases and Methodology

The 12-month project will unfold in four main phases:

1. **System Calibration and On-site Assessment**  
   Site surveys, geo-fencing configuration, and signal latency validation.

2. **Scenario-based Trials**  
   Executing use cases involving healthcare logistics, smart inspection, and route network testing.

3. **Data Logging and Safety Evaluation**  
   Capturing flight logs, safety event reports, and environmental performance metrics.

4. **Policy Feedback and Optimization**  
   Sharing trial insights with regulators to refine Hong Kong’s UAV regulations and urban airspace design.

## Shaping the Future of Smart Urban Skies

TAS Lab is proud to contribute to this pivotal national initiative that merges **academic research**, **industrial implementation**, and **policy shaping**. As Hong Kong sets its sights on becoming a regional leader in the **low-altitude economy**, projects like this will lay the groundwork for a sustainable and intelligent "smart sky" ecosystem.
