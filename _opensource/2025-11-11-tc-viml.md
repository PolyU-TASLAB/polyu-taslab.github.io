**[TC-VIML](https://github.com/ZHENGXi-git/TC-VIML)** proposes a tightly-coupled visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system that leverages a 3D prior line map for drift-free localization. Unlike loosely-coupled methods, our approach deeply integrates line features into a factor graph optimization framework, supported by a robust cross-modality matching and outlier rejection strategy.

**Key Contributions:**
- Tight integration of 2D image line features with a 3D prior line map via factor graph optimization
- Robust cross-modality matching and outlier rejection for line feature association
- First rigorous proof that the system achieves **full observability in global translation** (only yaw unobservable)
- Validated in both simulated and real-world urban driving environments
