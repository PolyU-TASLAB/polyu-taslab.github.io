Tightly-coupled Visual/Inertial/Map Integration with Observability Analysis for Reliable Localization of Intelligent Vehicles

<!-- Add Main body here -->
To enable reliable and drift-free localization for intelligent vehicles, we propose a tightly-coupled visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system that leverages a 3D prior line map. Unlike loosely-coupled methods, our approach deeply integrates line features into a factor graph optimization, supported by a robust cross-modality matching and outlier rejection strategy. For the first time, we rigorously prove that our system achieves full observability in global translation, leaving only the yaw angle unobservable. Evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments confirm the system's effectiveness.
