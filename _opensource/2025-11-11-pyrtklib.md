A complete <b class="blue">Python binding for RTKLIB</b>, bringing the full power of the most widely-used <b class="blue">GNSS positioning library</b> to the Python ecosystem.

**[pyrtklib](https://github.com/IPNL-POLYU/pyrtklib)** bridges the gap between RTKLIB's high-performance C implementation and the Python-based research workflows widely used in deep learning and data science. With pyrtklib, you can read RINEX files, process GNSS observations, and perform SPP, RTK, and PPP positioning — all from Python.

**Key Features:**
- Full Python interface to RTKLIB's core functions
- Supports SPP, DGNSS, RTK, and PPP positioning modes
- Seamless RINEX file reading and GNSS observation processing
- Enables tight integration of deep learning with GNSS positioning
- Available via PyPI for easy installation

**Quick Install:**
```bash
pip install pyrtklib        # Standard RTKLIB version
pip install pyrtklib5       # Based on rtklibexplorer/rtklib_demo5
```
