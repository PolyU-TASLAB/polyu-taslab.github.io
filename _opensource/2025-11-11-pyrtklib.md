<!-- Add breif description here.  -->
Unleash all the performance of the most popular GNSS library -- RTKLIB in python. A python binding for RTKLIB provides full functions. 


<!-- Add Main body here -->
This is a Python binding for RTKLIB, the most popular GNSS-RTK positioning C library. However, many researchers are currently using Python for research, especially in deep learning field. Thus, we implement this Python interface of RTKLIB to build a bridge between Python and positioning. By means of RTKLIB, you can easily read data from rinex file and process the positioning using the methods provided by RTKLIB, such as SPP, RTK, PPP.


For details, please refer to our official repository at [pyrtklib](https://github.com/IPNL-POLYU/pyrtklib) [![PyPI Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/pyrtklib?period=total&units=INTERNATIONAL_SYSTEM&left_color=BLACK&right_color=GREEN&left_text=downloads)](https://pepy.tech/projects/pyrtklib).

If you want to use the rtklib version based on rtklibexplorer/rtklib_demo5, please refer to [pyrtklib_demo5](https://github.com/IPNL-POLYU/pyrtklib_demo5) [![PyPI Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/pyrtklib5?period=total&units=INTERNATIONAL_SYSTEM&left_color=BLACK&right_color=GREEN&left_text=downloads)](https://pepy.tech/projects/pyrtklib5).

For quick install, you can use pip by
```bash
pip install pyrtklib
pip install pyrtklib5 #for rtklib_demo5
```
