Safety-quantifiable Line Feature-based Monocular Visual Localization with 3D Prior Map

<!-- Add Main body here -->
To address the drift and safety quantification challenges in visual localization, we propose a novel map-aided method that delivers both accurate pose estimates and a measurable error bound. By tightly integrating visual-inertial odometry with a prior line map, our system establishes geometric constraints between 2D image features and 3D map lines. Crucially, we introduce a GNSS-inspired integrity monitoring framework to compute a Protection Level (PL), which quantifies the potential error in both position and orientation, thereby certifying the solution's safety.
