<b class="blue">Safety-quantifiable</b> line feature-based monocular <b class="blue">visual localization</b> with 3D prior map and integrity monitoring.

**[SafetyQuantifiable-PLVINS](https://github.com/ZHENGXi-git/SafetyQuantifiable-PLVINS)** addresses drift and safety quantification challenges in visual localization by proposing a novel map-aided method that delivers both accurate pose estimates and a measurable error bound.

**Key Contributions:**
- Tightly integrates visual-inertial odometry with a prior 3D line map via geometric constraints between 2D image features and 3D map lines
- Introduces a **GNSS-inspired integrity monitoring framework** to compute a Protection Level (PL)
- Quantifies potential error in both position and orientation, certifying the solution's safety
- First application of integrity monitoring to visual localization systems
