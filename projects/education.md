## Abstract

<div style="text-align:justify; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.65;">
At the <b class="blue">TAS Lab</b>, we believe that cutting-edge research should go hand-in-hand with <b class="blue">innovative education</b>. Our research in Embodied AI for Robotics Education focuses on developing <b class="blue">AI-powered educational platforms</b> and <b class="blue">hands-on learning experiences</b> that bridge the gap between academic research and industry-ready skills. We leverage our expertise in autonomous systems — including <b class="blue">drones</b>, <b class="blue">ground robots</b>, and <b class="blue">intelligent vehicles</b> — to create immersive, project-based curricula that empower the next generation of roboticists and AI engineers.

<div style="text-align:justify; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.65; margin-top:0.6em;">
Our educational research integrates <b class="blue">embodied AI concepts</b> into university courses and outreach programs, enabling students to interact with real robotic hardware and state-of-the-art AI algorithms. From <b class="blue">GNSS-based navigation labs</b> to <b class="blue">end-to-end autonomous driving projects</b>, we design curricula that combine theoretical foundations with practical implementations, fostering both deep understanding and engineering competency.
