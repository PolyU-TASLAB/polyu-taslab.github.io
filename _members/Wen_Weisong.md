Dr. Weisong Wen is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He was also the associate director of Intelligent Positioning and Navigation Lab-IPNL which is led by Dr. Li-ta Hsu (He is also my Lifelong Mentor). Dr. Wen aims to build algorithm foundations for trustworthy navigation and control of autonomous systems. In particular, he aims to design pratical trustworthy and interactive autonomous systems (drones and intelligent vehicles) for the future society.

Dr. Wen received a BEng degree in Mechanical Engineering from Beijing Information Science and Technology University (BISTU), Beijing, China, in 2015, and a MEng degree in Mechanical Engineering from the China Agricultural University (CAU), in 2017. After that, he received a PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) supervised by Dr. Li-ta Hsu, in 2020. He was also a visiting PhD student with the Faculty of Engineering, University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) in 2018, supervised by Dr. Zhan and Prof. Tomizuka. For more details, please refer to my CV CV-Dr. Weisong Wen.

He has published more than 41 SCI papers and 40 conference papers in the field of GNSS (ION GNSS+) and navigation for Robotic systems (IEEE ICRA, IEEE ITSC, IPIN, MMT, ICUAS), such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and intelligent vehicles (IV). He won the Innovation Award from TechConnect 2021, the Best Presentation Award from the Institute of Navigation (ION) in 2020, and the First Prize in Hong Kong Section in Qianhai-Guangdong-Macao Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition in 2019 based on his research achievements in 3D LiDAR aided GNSS positioning for robotics navigation in urban canyons. The developed algorithms and technology method has been reported by top magazines such as Inside GNSS and has attracted industry recognition with remarkable knowledge transfer. He is also the Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology.
