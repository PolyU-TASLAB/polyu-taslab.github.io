Jianhao Jiao (Member, IEEE) received a Ph.D. in Electronic and Computer Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, in 2021. His research specializes in SLAM, sensor fusion, and robust robotic navigation, exemplified by pioneering works such as M-LOAM, FusionPortable dataset, and the scalable, structure-free visual navigation system, OpenNavMap. He has authored over ten papers in premier robotics venues (e.g., IROS, ICRA, NeurIPS, IJRR, IEEE TRO) and serves as an Associate Editor for RAL, IROS 2024-2025, ICRA 2025. Dr. Jiao’s ultimate research objective is to endow autonomous systems with lifelong, cognitive spatial memory mechanisms capable of dynamic updating, directed towards applications in challenging, unstructured environments such as subterranean mines and  forests.
